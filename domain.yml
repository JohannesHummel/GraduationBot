      The idea of Latex is, that you don't have to worry much about the appearance of your work,
      but you can focus more on the important thing, the actual writing.
      Latex uses commands to format text into tables, lists or just changes the appearance of the sentences. 
      


      Here is an example:
      > \\documentclass{{article}}
      > \\title{{Conversational User Interfaces in Education}}
      > \\author{{John Doe}}
      > \\date{{June 2021}}
      > \\begin{{document}}
      >   \\maketitle
      >   Hello world!
      > \\end{{document}}
